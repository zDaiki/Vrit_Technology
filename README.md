# Vrit Technology Frontend Intern Tasks

Welcome to my submission for the **Frontend Engineering Intern** selection process at Vrit Technologies.  
This repository contains four individual React-based UI tasks designed to showcase my frontend skills including React, Tailwind CSS, animations, and interactive UI components.

## Project Overview

This project is a React app with four distinct tasks, each demonstrating different UI/UX concepts and frontend development techniques:

- **Task 1:** Interactive testimonial section with animated user avatars, testimonial cards on hover, and floating GIF icons.
- **Task 2:** Skill journey cards with hover effects and dynamic content changes for the blue card.
- **Task 3:** Trending courses display with clickable animations and rotating text effects.
- **Task 4:** Animated grid display cycling through different frames of lit cells to create a dynamic pattern.

The app is built using React with Tailwind CSS and custom animations.
